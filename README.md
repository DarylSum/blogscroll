# üìú BlogScroll

![Blog deployment](https://github.com/blogscroll/blogscroll/workflows/Blog%20deployment/badge.svg)

An open directory of personal sites and blogs, maintained entirely on GitHub.

## üèó What is this?

This project was created by [Den Delimarsky](https://den.dev/) in an effort to bring attention to little digital gardens people maintain outside, well - walled gardens. In the past year, I found that I really enjoy reading people's personal stories, and discovering their own corners of the Internet. However, as it turns out there is no one place that I can visit to see what people are building, so I decided to whip this page up myself.

This is a nice replacement for the bookmarks I have in my browser, all aggregated into the **People** folder in the bookmarks bar.

And it goes without saying that this site is work in progress - your feedback is [very much welcome](https://github.com/blogscroll/blogscroll/issues)!
